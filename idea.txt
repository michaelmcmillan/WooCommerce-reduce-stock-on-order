# Ideas
Have a listener for an action/hook whenever a customer adds or removes a product from the cart.
    Keep a list of when the product was added to the cart and what item was added aswell as quantity.
        (cart_id, timestamp, item, quantity)    
    Reduce stock when product is added. Also listen for quantity changes.
    
    Try to avoid cron-jobs, instead check for expired "products" (say 15 minutes as default)
        When a product is expired increase stock to the original quantity.
    
    Use get_option/update_option to keep track of all the carts (serialized array?)
