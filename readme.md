# WooCommerce Reduce Stock on Order Plugin
#### A plugin which avoids collisions in checkout by reducing stock when an order is placed

When an item is added to the cart the quantity stays the same. It's only when the payment has been successful that the stock is reduced. Consider this scenario:

"User one" and "user two" have added the last available t-shirt to their carts. They proceed to place the order. At this point one of the two users are going to get this error.

From a users perspective this is pants-on-head retarded. Up to this point everything is filled out and ready to go - there's no indication that the product is unavailable, but the user is refused because someone else "beat them to the checkout". If you think of a real physical cart, this would never ever happen. When a product is placed in the cart it should always be available to the customer.

Let me be clear: The stock itself should not be altered with, but there should be some sort of flag that temporarily marks an item as reserved.

This is, by a wide margin, the most noodle-bending counterintuitive thing I have ever seen. I sincerely hope I've missed something, even though I've been through your classes and settings several timesWhen an item is added to the cart the quantity stays the same.
